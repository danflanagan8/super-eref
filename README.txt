Super Entity Reference Entity Formatter
=======================================

Consider this: You have an Entity Reference field. It can reference several
different bundles. You can use the "Rendered entity" formatter to
display the referenced entities in whatever view mode you'd like...but you can
only pick one view mode. Every now and then it might be nice to display one
bundle as a teaser while displaying a different bundle in its
full view mode.

The Super EREF module provides a field formatter that solves this problem.
Display your entity reference field using "Rendered entity (flexible)"
and you'll be able to pick different view modes for different content types.

It also works for Entity Reference Revisions (like Paragraphs). That's the
Super ERREF plugin.
